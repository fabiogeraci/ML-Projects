At Present, healthcare management witnesses a growing demand for structured healthcare planning and resource management. Coordination is required especially in those cases in which hospitals have structured healthcare into specialty-oriented units, while a substantial portion of patient care is not limited to single units.From a logistic point of view, this multi-disciplinary patient care creates a tension between controlling the hospital’s units, and the need for a control of the patient ﬂow between units. A possible solution is the creation of new units in which different specialties work together for speciﬁc groups of patients[1]. Therefore, the concept of groupings of patients and treatment episodes are fundamental tobetteranalysisofdataforhealthservicesmanagement.Inthis project, distance based and model based clustering techniques have been developed to identify the salient patient groups in need of multi-disciplinary care.

The most widely known patient classiﬁcation developed for healthcare management purposes is diagnosis related groups (DRG)[2] which, on the basis of diagnosis and/or procedure, classiﬁes acute hospital episodes into groups of similar expected resource use. Similarly, iso-resource groupings have been developed for other care settings, for example resource utilization groups (RUGs)[4] for longstay care, ambulatory visit groups (AVGs)[5] and ambulatory patient groups (APGs)[6] for out-patient/ambulatory settings and so on.The driving force for these groupings has been a managerial approach to healthcare systems for logical development of program planning and budgeting to provide services (healthcare episodes) to distinct patient groups efﬁciently.

This project could be applied to several applications including but not limited to healthcare planning, resource management and reduced healthcare cost of patients in terms of organised health insurance.

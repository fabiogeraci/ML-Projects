A Novel Approach To DeepFake Video Detection

Abstractâ€“ Manipulated images and videos have become increasingly realistic due to the tremendous progress of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While technically intriguing, such progress raises a number of social concerns
related to the advent and spread of fake information. Such concerns necessitate the introduction of robust and reliable
methods for fake image and video detection [1]. In this project we investigated some of the state of the art detection
methodologies including pre-trained CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, Xception, InceptionResNetV2), Baseline CNN from
scratch, CNN-LSTM architecture (Several variations - sequential, Integrated approach, altering pre-trained models)
, Domain Adapted GAN (Discriminator), 3DCNN (A variation of C3D architecture) to evaluate and compare their
performance on Kaggle deep-fake detection challenge data-set. The findings from this project indicates that performance
of these state of the art methodologies rely on not only more computing resources, longer training time, accurate face
detection, video compression rate, image noise, video resolution but also huge number of training examples to form a
comprehensive training data distribution to discern between fake and authentic videos.

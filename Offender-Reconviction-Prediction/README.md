The criminal courts in England and Wales may request the probation service to submit pre-sentence reports which are considered by magistrates and judges before making their sentencing decision. Pre-sentence reports must include an assessment of the risk of re-offending and the risk of harm to the public which the convicted offender presents. This project provides a statistical aid to such risk assessment.
